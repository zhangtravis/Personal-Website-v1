						A Model for Solar Data: Spatial Interpolation and Compression<sup>1</sup>
					</h3>
					<p class="date">
						2017-2018
					</p>
					<p class="content">
						The  power  grid  is  primarily  reliant  on  fossil  fuels,  the  main  source  of  CO2emissions,  to  provide  energy  to  consumers.   Integrating  solar  photo-voltaicpower is becoming increasingly important.  Unlike fossil fuels, solar power isstochastic and integrating it increases the uncertainty in power system plan-ning.  This study aims to predict the power output of solar panels using smallamounts of data.  This is important because it allows solar energy to be inte-grated on a large scale and reduces uncertainty in power system planning. Inthis project, a model for solar data analytics is proposed that incorporates tem-poral and spatial interpolation of the power production measurements.  Thegoal is to reduce the amount of data that needs to be stored, realign and fillgaps for missing data and, ultimately, provide a way to predict future poweroutput in different locations.  The method is viable for both solar plants anddistributed residential deployments and takes into account variations in thegeographical elements in each location as well as cloud coverage as an attenu-ation of the two components that make up the deterministic solar irradiationpattern.

						GAN-based Synthetic Medical Image Augmentation <br>for Increased CNN Performance in Skin Cancer Classification
					</h3>
					<p class="date">
						2018-2019
					</p>
					<p class="content">
						Skin cancer, the most common human malignancy, is primarily diagnosed vi-sually, beginning with an initial clinical screening and followed potentially bydermoscopic analysis, a biopsy and histopathological examination. Automatedclassification of skin lesions using images is a challenging task due to the in-sufficiency caused by the significant cost and time spent generating and an-notating the images and fine-grained variability.   Deep convolutional neuralnetworks (CNNs) show potential for general and highly variable tasks acrossmany fine-grained object categories.  However, a major limitation regardingmachine learning methods like CNNs is that they require a significantly largenumber of images to achieve high accuracy.   This project proposes a GAN-based approach to synthetically augment the dataset.  Results show an over-all increase of approximately 5% in categorical accuracy and equal or higherAUC scores within each ROC curve graph after implementing GAN-generatedsynthetic images, indicating a higher performance using both real and GAN-generated images within CNN classification.

						Knowledge on Transformation Invariance and <br>Active Learning Improves Model Robustness Under Limited Data<sup>2</sup>
					</h3>
					<p class="date">
						2019-2020
					</p>
					<p class="content">
						Vulnerability of neural networks under adversarial attacks has created an arms race between the development of defenseand attack mechanisms, with adversarial training (AT) standing out with genuine (yet not always sufficient) robustness. Tsipras et al.(2018) proved that AT intrinsically learns robust features with strong correlation with labels. We show in this paper that standard AT inevitably leads to incorrect identification of robust features due to the variances in correlation estimations. We then show that bothTRADES and augmenting AT through transformation invariant attacks alleviate this challenge by learning a conservative set of stronglyrobust features. Lastly, we show that actively attacking samples with high decision uncertainty during AT improves model robustnessfrom the prior state of the art. Empirical results on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and Restricted Imagenet are reported

						Equity Symposium App

					<p class="content">
						As a high school junior, I led the development of my school district's first iOS and Android app for their annual Equity Symposium. I developed the iOS version of the app, while I supervised two other high school students on the Android version. Because this was one of the first apps that I have developed, I was able to reinforce and apply app development skills for a specific purpose. After the first year, I began to develop revisions to the original app, by connecting the app to Google Firebase and developing a personalized system for every Equity Symposium member.

						During my senior year in high school, I developed both the iOS and Android app for my school's National Honor Society. With Google Firebase, I was able to develop a custom login screen and personalized information for each member. In addition, I developed pages to submit certain forms to my database and code for me to send out announcements through the database.
