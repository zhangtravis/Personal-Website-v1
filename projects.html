						A Model for Solar Data: Spatial Interpolation and Compression<sup>1</sup>
					</h3>
					<p class="date">
						2017-2018
					</p>
					<p class="content">
						Current electrical grids throughout the world are primarily powered by fossil fuels,&nbsp;one of the main sources of carbon dioxide emissions. This problem has motivated many to develop renewable alternatives to fossil fuels,&nbsp;with solar photo-voltaic power bringing great promise to switching to sustainable renewable energy. However,&nbsp;unlike fossil fuels,&nbsp;solar power is stochastic due to continuously-changing cloud conditions that could affect the performance of these devices and as a result,&nbsp;integrating them into the grid raises uncertainty in power system planning. In addition,&nbsp;the data collected from solar photo-voltaic devices typically have missing values,&nbsp;which can further increase this uncertainty. This study aims to develop a model that both spatially and temporally interpolates the missing power values,&nbsp;but also forecasts future power outputs,&nbsp;in hopes of easing the integration of renewable energy into electrical grids. The proposed methodology reduces the amount of data that needs to be stored,&nbsp;realigns and fills gaps in missing data,&nbsp;and takes into account variations in the geographical elements and cloud coverage of each location.

						GAN-based Synthetic Medical Image Augmentation <br>for Increased CNN Performance in Skin Cancer Classification
					</h3>
					<p class="date">
						2018-2019
					</p>
					<p class="content">
						Skin cancer,&nbsp;the most common human malignancy,&nbsp;is primarily diagnosed visually,&nbsp;beginning with an initial clinical screening and followed potentially bydermoscopic analysis,&nbsp;a biopsy and histopathological examination. Automatedc lassification of skin lesions using images is a challenging task due to the insufficiency caused by the significant cost and time spent generating and annotating the images and fine-grained variability. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show potential for general and highly variable tasks across many fine-grained object categories. However,&nbsp;a major limitation regarding machine learning methods like CNNs is that they require a significantly large number of images to achieve high accuracy,&nbsp;and current augmentation methods are limited to creating new data close to the original data distribution. With the recent introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),&nbsp;which have the capability to generate new data out of the original data distribution,&nbsp;this project proposes a GAN-based approach to increase CNN performance. Results show an overall increase of approximately 5% in categorical accuracy and equal or higher AUC scores with each type of skin lesion after implementing GAN-generated synthetic images.

						Knowledge on Transformation Invariance and <br>Active Learning Improves Model Robustness Under Limited Data<sup>2</sup>
					</h3>
					<p class="date">
						2019-2020
					</p>
					<!-- TODO: Remove Citations -->
					<p class="content">
						Vulnerability of neural networks under adversarial attacks has created an arms race between the development of defense and attack mechanisms,&nbsp;with adversarial training (AT) standing out with genuine (yet not always sufficient) robustness. Tsipras et al.(2018) proved that AT intrinsically learns robust features with strong correlation with labels. The aim of this project was to not only prove that standard AT inevitably leads to incorrect identification of robust features due to the variances in correlation estimations,&nbsp;but also show that both TRADES (Zhang et al. 2019) and augmenting AT through transformation invariant attacks,&nbsp;the proposed methodology,&nbsp;alleviate this challenge by learning a conservative set of strongly robust features. Additionally,&nbsp;we show that actively attacking samples with high decision uncertainty during AT improves model robustness from the prior state of the art.

						Adversarial Attacks Against Reinforcement Learning Algorithms<sup>2</sup>
					</h3>
					<p class="date">
						2020-Present
					</p>
					<p class="content">
						Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have had tremendous success when it came to solving various RL problems, but studies have proven that they are susceptible to adversarial attacks, similar to deep neural networks in classification problems. Prior works mostly focused on directly perturbing the input states of RL agents, merely to prove that attacking a RL agent was possible, but having access to the RL agent is impractical in the real world. This project works to develop a method to perturb an object in the environment of an RL agent such that the perturbed object acts as the adversarial attack towards the agent.

						Equity Symposium App
					</h3>
					<p class="date">
						2018-2020
					</p>
					<p class="content">
						As a high school junior, I led the development of my school district's first iOS and Android app for their annual Equity Symposium. I developed the iOS version of the app, while I supervised two other high school students on the Android version. Because this was one of the first apps that I have developed, I was able to reinforce and apply app development skills for a specific purpose. After the first year, I began to develop revisions to the original app, by connecting the app to Google Firebase and developing a personalized system for every Equity Symposium member.
